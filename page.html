          Mecca is the holiest city in the world in Islam. The city of Mecca and the surrounding areas are unsurpassed in its historical and religious significance to more than 1.9 billion people around the world. Prophet Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born in Mecca.<br><br>
The first verses of the Holy Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad () in a cave named Hira on Mount Al-Nur on the outskirts of Mecca. The holiest site in Islam, the Kaaba, is located in Mecca. The direction of ritual prayer, called the Qiblah, is to the Kaaba in Mecca. The holiest water in the world to Muslims is found in a well named Zamzam in Mecca. Millions of Muslims make pilgrimage to Mecca every year known as Umrah and Hajj. Mecca and Madinah will be the only two cities in the world protected by rows of angels that will not let the Anti-Christ (Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal) enter.<br><br>
